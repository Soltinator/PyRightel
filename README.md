# PyRightel

A simple Wrapper for the MyRightel API (WIP)

## About The Project

PyRightel is a python library wrapping the my.rightel.ir API to be automated using python scripts.

Rightel is an Iranian-based simcard operator with my Rightel portal that allows you to see usage, history and buy data packages for your simcards.
This library is a wrapper for their public API, and it allows the user to do most of the things possible using a command line or an automated script for multiple simcards instead of their app and website.

### Built With

- [python v3.9.0](https://www.python.org)

### Using

- requests v2.32.5
- PyJWT v2.10.1
